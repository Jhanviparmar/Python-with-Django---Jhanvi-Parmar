Day-02
Today we learnt about python comments, variables and datatypes.
Single line comments are shown as "#" at starting of line whereas multiline comments can be done by using """ or ''' at start and end of lines.
In python, unlike other langueges like c or java, we don't have to specify the variable type.
Python itself understands that which type of variable has been declared.
There are mainly 5 types of datatypes in python listed below:
1. Numbers
2. String
3. List - mutable
4. Tuple - immutable
5. Dictionary
