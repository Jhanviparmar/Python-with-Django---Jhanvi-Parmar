Day-04
Today we got to know about python functions mainly about the syntax like function name, indentation and function body.
>def keyword marks the start of function header.
>A function name uniquely identify it.
>A colon(:) to mark the end of function header.
>An optional return statement to return a value from the function.

-->There are three types of python function arguments using which we can call functions.
1. Default Arguments
2. Keyword Arguments
3. Variable-length Arguments.
    >>An Astrisk(*) is placed for non-keyworded variable lengths.
    >>Double Astrisks(**) is placed for keyworded variable lengths.

-->Scope of variables:
1. Global variables
2. Local variables
>>>Variables those are defined inside a function body is called local scope whereas of outside are called global scope.
 
--> Indentation plays crucial role in python prgramming. Without proper identation there will be compile time error.

-->Modules in python:
>Modules are used to break down large programs into small manageble and organised files.
>import is the main and heavily used python module.

-->Operators in Python:
1. Arithmetic Operators ( +, -, *, /, %, //, ** )
2. Comparison Operators ( >, <, ==, !=, >=, <= )
3. Logical Operators ( and, or, not )
4. Assignment Operators ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=)
5. Membership Operators ( in, not in )
6. Identity Operators (is, is not )

TASK-04
We were given number of programmes to execute with the use of fuctions, modules, scope and operators.
